# Pushdown Automaton (PDA) Simulator

A simple Pushdown Automaton (PDA) simulator that processes input strings and determines whether they are accepted based on automaton rules.

This project demonstrates core concepts from automata theory and stack-based computation.

- Acceptance / rejection decision
- Clear execution logic

## Description

A Pushdown Automaton (PDA) is a computational model similar to a finite automaton but with an additional stack memory. This allows it to recognize context-free languages.

The simulator reads an input string symbol-by-symbol, updates the automaton state, and performs stack operations (push/pop). At the end of execution, it determines whether the input is accepted.
